Partial copy of the site The Movie Database for learning purposes.
In the process of creating this site, I learned how to: work with API, describe styles using TailwindCSS, describe types using TypeScript. I began to better understand how to work with hooks such as useState, useEffect. I learned how to extract data from URL using hooks from 'react-router-dom' such as useParams, useSearchParams and how to navigate between pages with/without dynamic parameters.
Used such technologies as: React, Redux, TypeScript, TailwindCSS.
The data is taken from the The Movie Database API.
